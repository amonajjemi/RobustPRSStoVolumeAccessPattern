Private Range Search Scheme: Robust Against Volume and Access Pattern Attacks

Here is our github for our CSE 290x research project

our_se_v1.cpp is the construction for the Search Efficient Range Scheme
  it is currently not working properly with some issue with the OMAP when it is defined through the static/Amortized libraries
  
secondConstruction.cpp is the construction for the Space Efficient Range Scheme

we utilize tools from https://github.com/jgharehchamani/Small-Client-SSE
